Key findings

Visibility/Feedback of System Status
When users perform actions like adding or editing payment methods, they receive immediate feedback through alerts (e.g., "A new method has been saved!" or "Please correct the highlighted").

User Control and Freedom
Users are provided with a "Cancel" button to abort the process of adding a new payment method.

Consistency and Standards
Buttons ("Delete," "Edit," "Add New Method," "Submit," "Cancel") have consistent styling, which aids in recognition and predictability.

Error Prevention
Validation: Basic input validation is performed (e.g., checking for empty fields, validating card numbers, expiration dates, and security codes).


Potential Improvements

Error Prevention
Before deleting or editing payment methods, users might benefit from a confirmation dialog to prevent accidental actions.

 Help and Documentation
While the interface seems straightforward, providing help or documentation for users who might be unfamiliar with certain terms or processes could enhance usability.
