- Positive Findings

User control and freedom
The system ensures that users select only one payment method at a time by unchecking every other checkbox except the currently selected one.

User control and freedom
Providing an option to add new payment methods or edit existing ones directly from this page will enhance user convenience.

Recognition rather than recall
Displaying payment method details reduces the need for users to recall previously entered information and understands better which option they should go with.

- Potential Improvements

Confirmation for Payment Selection
As payment is a security prioritized process, adding a confirmation mechanism after selecting a payment method could prevent accidental selections. Providing users with the option to confirm their choice or undo their selection would help reduce the likelihood of errors and enhance user control.

Recognition rather than recall
As payment is a significant decision that is not easily reversible, providing a summary or review section before payment submission would help users confirm their choices.
