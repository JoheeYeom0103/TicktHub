User Heuristic Testing for Admin Dashboard:
---------------------------------------------------

1. Overview
----------------------

The heuristic testing of the administrator dashboard aimed to evaluate its usability and user experience.

2. Key Findings
----------------------

Visibility of System Status: 
- When tasks were completed like approving or denying an event, it is difficult for the user to see whether their actions were successful
- A confirmation message or alert to let them know before they complete an action would be helpful

User Control:
- Users can easily navigate to and from their account page and the dashboard 
- validation is in place to prevent bad input

Overall function:
- When users interact with the administrator dashboard all relevant information is being shown
- On the user tab, the list of users is correctly displaying all data in the database
- On the sales tab, sales data is correctly being calculated and returned from the database 
- On the user request tab, administrators can easily reject and approve both exisitng and new events.
  The data is being displayed correctly from the database and the button function to reject and approve
  work as intended, changing the status of the event in the database and subsequent pages. 

3. Potential Improvements:
-----------------------
- Adding alerts on successful admin changes (e.g. approving/rejecting an event)
- Providing alerts before the admin completes an action to verify what they are about to dashboard
