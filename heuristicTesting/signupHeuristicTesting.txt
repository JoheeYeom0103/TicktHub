User Heuristic Testing for Signup Page:
---------------------------------------------------

1. Overview
----------------------

The heuristic testing of the signup page aimed to evaluate its usability and user experience.

2. Key Findings
----------------------

Visibility of System Status: 
- When signup was not successful, helpful error messages were displayed to help the user correct any errors and make a successful signup attempt
- Information boxes to show what should be input in the fields helped the user signup successfully
- The option to enter the system as a buyer or seller helped the user create the most ideal type of account for their situation
- Validation of fields ensures that their information is stored properly in the database and no bad input is given

User Control:
- Validation is in place on the client and backend side of the program to check against bad user input
- Upon successful signup, the user is able to see the most relevant home page with links to their profile. 

Overall function:
- Users can signup according to their role (seller, buyer)
- Users land on the appropriate page after a subsequent successful signup

3. Potential Improvements:
-----------------------
- Adding more specific error messages could help the user better identify where they went wrong when signing up.
- Having a way for admins to be added to the system would be beneficial from a business owner perspective
