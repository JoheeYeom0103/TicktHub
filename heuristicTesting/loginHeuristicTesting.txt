---------------------------------------------------

1. Overview
----------------------

The heuristic testing of the login page aimed to evaluate its usability and user experience.

2. Key Findings

Visibility of System Status: 
- When login was not successful, helpful error messages were displayed to help the user correct any errors and make a successful login attempt
- Information boxes to show what should be input in the fields helped the user login successfully

User Control:
- Validation is in place on the client and backend side of the program to check against bad user input
- Upon successful login, the user is able to see their home page with links to their profile. 

Overall function:
- Users can login according to their role (seller, buyer, admin)
- Users land on the appropriate page after a subsequent successful login

3. Potential Improvements:
-----------------------
- Adding more specific error messages could help the user better identify where they went wrong when logging in.
